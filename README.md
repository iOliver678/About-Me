## ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Oliver Majano!

I'm a sophomore Computer Science student at San Jose State University, navigating the tech world with a focus on building impactful projects and embracing challenges. My journey in tech started with an ambition to make a difference in my community, especially by providing resources and guidance to underrepresented students in STEM.

### ðŸš€ What I'm Working On
- **MMA Community App** â€“ A personal project that allows users to pick events, gamble with virtual money, and make parlays for fun. This app combines my passion for tech with my love for sports, creating a unique community experience.

### ðŸ”¥ Past Projects
- **Reverse Rate My Professor** â€“ A web app that lets SJSU students easily see the best professors for any given course, simplifying the search for quality instruction.
- **NutriLens AR** â€“ An augmented reality project that provides real-time nutrition data using Snap Spectacles, combining AR and AI to deliver valuable insights while cooking.
- **URL Shortener** â€“ Developed a custom URL shortener for the Software Engineering Clubâ€™s website, currently serving over 100 users. This project introduced me to backend design and API integration with React for the frontend.
- **Stock Tracker** â€“ Built a Stock Tracker app to follow market trends and track stock performance over time. This project sharpened my data handling skills and provided me with insights into financial analysis.


### ðŸ’¡ Interests
- **Augmented Reality** â€“ Passionate about how AR can reshape user experiences, especially in gaming and tech communities. Recently applied for an internship at Niantic, where I hope to bring my ideas to life!
- **Nvidia & Omniverse** â€“ Iâ€™m deeply inspired by the work Nvidia is doing, especially with Omniverse, as it opens up innovative possibilities for virtual collaboration and simulation. The potential impact of AI and simulation in areas like autonomous vehicles is exciting, and Iâ€™m drawn to exploring how these technologies can shape the future.
- **Artificial Intelligence** â€“ The ability of AI to transform industries and enhance everyday life is something Iâ€™m passionate about. From practical applications to ethical considerations, Iâ€™m constantly learning how to integrate AI into meaningful projects.
- **Mentorship & Community Building** â€“ As an officer in SJSUâ€™s Software Engineering Club, I help new students get on the right path, make connections, and develop skills in computer science. Building a supportive community is a mission Iâ€™m proud to contribute to.

### ðŸ”§ Skills
- **Programming Languages**: Java, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript
- **Frameworks/Tools**: React.js, FastAPI, MySQL
- **Projects**: From URL shorteners for my clubâ€™s website to data-driven tools for my university, I'm always looking to take on new challenges.

### ðŸ“ˆ On a Mission
As a first-generation Latino in tech, Iâ€™m determined to make an impact, not just for myself but for others coming from similar backgrounds. My goal is to develop my skills, grow in the industry, and one day become a mentor to future generations, showing them that anything is possible with the right mindset.
